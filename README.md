Chocolate edits Raxz's files. It can work without it, but the gameplay experience will inconsistent.

### ArmorFix Fixed (also known as ArmorFix v2)

[clockworkcore](http://clockworkcore.org/modindex.html)

Almost every balance tweak in Chocolate assumes you're using ArmorFix. No public link exists for v2 since Torchmodders went down and the link provided only lists v1, you can either install v1 for a very similar experience or ask around for v2.

## Public Build (?)

Only if I eventually get permission to publish a merge with dependencies included.

#### This mod goes above its dependecies on the load order.

#### This mod edits files from the base base game, son it can cause unexpected results when combined with other mods.
